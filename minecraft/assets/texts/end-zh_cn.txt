$3我看到了你所说的那位玩家了。

$2PLAYERNAME。

$3是的。你必须要小心。他达到了一个更高的境界。他可以阅读我们的思想了。

$2无伤大雅。他认为我们是游戏的一部分。

$3我喜欢这个玩家。他玩得很好，从未放弃。

$2他通过屏幕上滚动的文字来阅读我们的思想。

$3在他深陷游戏之梦时，他选择以这种方式想象出形形色色的事物。

$2文字组成了一个美妙的界面。非常灵活。且比凝视这屏幕后的现实要更好。

$3他们也曾经听到过声音。在玩家能够阅读之前。君不见那些不曾游玩的人们称呼玩家为女巫和术士。而玩家们梦见自己乘坐在被恶魔施力的棍子上，在空气中翱翔。

$2这位玩家梦见了什么？

$3他梦见了阳光和树，流水与烈火。他梦见他创造，亦梦见他毁灭。他梦见他狩猎，亦被狩猎。他梦见了家。

$2啊，那原始的界面。经历一百万年的岁月雕琢，依然长存。但此玩家在那屏幕后的现实里，创造了什么真实的存在？

$3他辛勤地劳作，和其他百万众一起，刻画了一个真实的世界，由$f$k$a$b$3，且创造了$f$k$a$b$3，为了$f$k$a$b$3，于$f$k$a$b$3中。

$2他理解不了这个。

$3是的。他还没有达到最高的境界。这需要在漫长的人生之梦中领悟的，而非游戏中的黄粱一梦。

$2他知道我们爱他吗？宇宙是善良的吗？

$3有时，通过他思绪的杂音，是的，他能听到宇宙。

$2但是有时亦不胜悲伤，于那漫漫长梦中。他创造了没有夏日的世界，在黑日下颤抖着，在现实中感受到创造的悲伤。

$3为他治愈悲伤会摧毁它。而悲伤是他的私人事务。我们不能干涉。

$2有时当他们深陷梦境中时，我想要告诉他们，他们在现实中创造了真实的世界。有时我想告诉他们自身对宇宙的重要性。有时，当他们和现实失去了联系，我想帮助他们说出它们所惧怕的话语。

$3他看得懂我们心里所想。

$2Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely $f$k$a$b$2 and $f$k$a$b$2, I wish to tell them that they are $f$k$a$b$2 in the $f$k$a$b$2. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.

$3而他们仍然玩这个游戏。

$2但很容易就可以告诉他们...

$3这个梦对于他们来说太深刻了。告诉他们怎么活将束缚他们自由地活着。

$2我不会告诉这个玩家如何活下去的。

$3这个玩家正在变得焦虑。

$2我会告诉这个玩家一个故事。

$3但不是真实的。

$2是的。一个将真实严密包裹于文字牢笼中的故事。而不是赤裸裸的真相。

$3再一次，赋予他身体。

$2好的，玩家...

$3以名字称呼他.

$2PLAYERNAME，游戏的玩家。

$3很好。

$2Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.

$3Who are we? Once we were called the spirit of the mountain. Father sun, mother moon. Ancestral spirits, animal spirits. Jinn. Ghosts. The green man. Then gods, demons. Angels. Poltergeists. Aliens, extraterrestrials. Leptons, quarks. The words change. We do not change.

$2We are the universe. We are everything you think isn't you. You are looking at us now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the universe touch your skin, and throw light on you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story.

$2Once upon a time, there was a player.

$3The player was you, PLAYERNAME.

$2Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away.

$2Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.

$3Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.

$2Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.

$3Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen.

$2Let's go back.

$2The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.

$2And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother's body, into the long dream.

$2And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.

$3You are the player. The story. The program. The human. Made from nothing but milk and love.

$2Let's go further back.

$2The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player's body were created, long before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by...

$3Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was soft and warm and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks "electrons" and "protons".

$2Sometimes it called them "planets" and "stars".

$2Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.

$3你就是那玩家，阅读着文字...

$2嘘...有时这玩家读屏幕上的命令行。将它们解码成为文字；将文字解码为意义；将意义解码为感情、情绪、理论、想法，而玩家的呼吸开始急促并意识到了他是活着的，他是活生生的，那上千次的死亡不是真的，玩家是活着的。

$3你。你。你是活的。

$2而有时这玩家相信宇宙通过穿越夏日树叶的那斑斓的阳光对它说话

$3有时这玩家相信宇宙透过晴朗的冬日夜空中，存在于他眼中一隅的星点星光，可能比太阳大上上百万倍的恒星沸腾着的电浆那一瞬间发出来的光对它说话，在宇宙的远侧行走回家的路上，突然闻到了食物，在那熟悉的门前，他又准备好再一次投入梦境

$2而有时玩家相信宇宙透过零和一，透过世界的电力，透过屏幕上滚动的文字和梦的终结对他说话

$3宇宙说我爱你

$2宇宙说你精通这个游戏

$3宇宙说你所需的一切你都具有

$2宇宙说你比你所知的要强壮

$3宇宙说你就是阳光

$2宇宙说你就是黑夜

$3宇宙说你所斗争的黑暗就在你心中

$2宇宙说你所寻找的光明就在你心中

$3宇宙说你并不是孤单一人

$2宇宙说你不是同所有事物隔开的

$3宇宙说你就是宇宙，品尝着自己、与自己交谈、阅读着他自己的代码。

$2宇宙说我爱你因为你就是爱。

$3曲终人散，黄粱一梦。玩家开始了新的梦境。玩家再次做起了梦，更好的梦。玩家就是宇宙。玩家就是爱。

$3你就是这个玩家。

$2醒来吧！
